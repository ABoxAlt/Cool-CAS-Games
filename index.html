    Page header html, I typically use id's if the page only uses the object once
    Its probably better to use classes though ill explain why now
    basically in css theres a hirearchy of style

    3. first the element so for links writing a on the stylesheet
    2. classes (which gameLink is) denoted with a . before the name in css
    1. ids (which pageTitle and titleSeparator are) denoted with a # before the name in css

    style is overturned if the style is higher on the hirearchy ie: id's outrank classes and the element
    we can change these id's to be styles but it probably wont be a huge deal we'll see

    This is placed within a text element (<p> text here </p>) because it lets us use text align
    which is way nicer than trying to do shenanigans with margins, though that is also an option
    if we need to change it later

    This is also below the title but it's just those horizontal lines on the site we can 
    replace this with images or whatever later but they work fine as placeholders

    Most of this stuff is repeated in the other HTML docs but i'll explain script and css linking there
