    Similarly to how the CSS links just for Javascript files instead

    This CANNOT GO IN THE HEAD IT HAS TO GO IN THE BODY
    I forget that a lot but it gives you an error and you just don't get to use the script
    this is only really a problem when you need to nab html elements
    this is because the head and body are separate containers and you cannot grab elements
    from another container
